# Eureka!

Welcome to the official repository of Eureka!, an immersive mobile survival game developed using Unity. In Eureka!, players step into a world where survival is not just a goal but an art. Using diverse tools, players can craft weapons, gadgets, and armor to protect themselves from a host of enemies that spawn randomly across the map.
